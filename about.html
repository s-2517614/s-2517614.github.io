  <p>The game I'm working on is a game about exploring your inner conciousness, delving into depths of the mind that are
  impossible to reach in the waking world. You must solve puzzles and navigate the complex field of thoughts and feelings to get yourself
  to wake up. Turns out, there's a lot that goes on in your mind even in rest...</p>
  <h2>About the Story</h2>
  
  <p>You play as a person with a debilitating sleep disorder who has decided to participate in a 
  clinical trial for a new sleep aid. The nurses and pharmacists are nice and plesant, the room you're in is calming, and the drugs are
  effective. But starting out, you have some pretty strange dreams. They assure you it's all normal, and maybe you really just haven't slept
  enough to experience dreams like this, but the stuff that goes on is a little more than just a side effect, you think.
  Or maybe it's just one hell of a placebo.</p>
    
  

  <h2>About the Gameplay</h2>

  <!--  HTML has three ways to generate a list. The ol tag creates an ordered list (with numbers), the ul tag create an
        unordered list, with bullets. The li tag is used in both kinds of lists for the list items. -->

    <dt><b>Waking Hours</b></dt>
    <dd>When you're awake, you can wander around your room and a small part of the facility to your hearts content. Look around and see what
    you can find. There are some rules, though- don't go into the doctor's offices, and DON'T talk with other participants. Though, there
    doesn't seem to ba a lot of people here to enforce those rules.</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Dream State</b></dt>
    <dd>Your dreams are kind of...weird. You're in control of yourself (which the nurse says is kind of uncommon), but you can't seem to control
    the rest of your dreams. Each one is different, a different time, space, theme, what have you. Some reflect on your waking world, the others
    you can't seem to figure out. The one thing that's sure, though, you have to make it through to it's "conclusion" to wake up.</dd>
    
    
  <!-- Cause a break in filling text. You might use this in an address between the street and the city so that
            they would be displayed on different lines. The br tag just starts a new line, it does not add space or 
            do indenting like a paragraph (p) tag. -->
